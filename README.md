# Unit 2 Homework

In this homework I was tasked to create a portfolio webpage that can showcase all the projects I have created and make sure it is able to be easily updated when new additions are ready to be added. I used placeholder images for the portions I do not have ready yet.

The criteria for this homework includes the following:
* Must provide your name, a recent photo,  working links to sections about you, and contact info
* The showcased applications need a link to them and a proper title
* The first application has to be larger than the others
* If you click on the application image it takes you to the live webpage
* The page has to be responsive to various screen sizes and devices
